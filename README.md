# data-analysis-on-Sabre-fencing-DA401
In this research paper, we investigate the effect of these variables on the decisions of Sabre fencers in the middle. Our hypothesis is that the start movement of fencers and the place of their back foot do have an impact on fencers' decisions. To test this hypothesis, we collected data from top-level Sabre fencing videos and analyzed the starts of the fencers, the positions of their backfoot, and their movements before and after the middle. We then used decision tree modeling to visualize the relationship between these variables and the fencers' decisions and built a classifier to predict the fencers' decisions based on these variables. We also used Na√Øve-Bayes classifier to get a more precise predictions of the decisions made by fencers in the middle of the strips. We used the Importance plot to show the effect of each independent variables gives to the dependent variables. We also analyze the change of the probabilities of launch and stop when adding some new variables in the model by using the visual of decision tree.

In the rmd file, there are the code of decision tree, Naive-Bayes classifier with K fold CV and Naive-Bayes classifier with LOOCV. Also there are some code for data cleaning part. The dataset is collect by myself manually. The links of all the videos are provided in the GitHub Repos.
